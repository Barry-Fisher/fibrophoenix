# Spoons calculator to reduce pain and fatigue
One of the things I used to struggle with a lot is overdoing it.

The good days were rare so when I had one,
I used to try and get everything done I had been wanting to do all in one day – and inevitably land myself
right back in flare up again.

I’d heard about the ‘spoons’ theory (the link is here if you don’t know what I
am referring to) which made sense to me and I knew that I shouldn’t do ‘too much’ but how much was
too much? Often I’d actually feel okay at the time and it was only later that I’d pay for my activities.

I decided to create a ‘spoons calculator’ and started guess-timating how much each activity took out of
me and tried to work out how much I could reasonably achieve without causing a negative reaction in my
pain and energy levels.

It took a bit of tweaking and revising but eventually I had a sort of road map that I
could use to navigate my energy levels. I awarded myself points according to how well I had slept and for
how long, points according to how much pain I was in that day and whether there were any extenuating
circumstances such as ‘Did I have a cold?’ or ‘Was I particularly stressed for some reason?’ and came up
with an approximate daily score. I then looked at the activities I did regularly and tried to work out how
much energy each took out of me. I could spend my ‘spoons’ like pounds in a shop on the activities I
wanted.

I trialled my ‘spoons calculator’ by taking my energy score for that day and working out how
much or little I ought to be doing based on that. What I noticed was that I had been frequently pushing
myself too hard without realising.

I started alternating physical activities with sedentary ones and
gradually I started to stabilise. I was no longer having the rollercoaster of energy crashes I had previously
struggled with. I started to recognise the days that caused me the most trouble and understand why they
were so problematic for me. This allowed me to make adjustments to make them more achievable for me.

Nowadays, as a result, my sense of what I can cope with is more accurate and I don’t often feel the need
to use my spoons calculator but I know that if I start to struggle it is a tool I can use to help me figure out
what went wrong and get back on track again.
