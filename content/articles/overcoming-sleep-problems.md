# How I overcame Fibromyalgia sleep problems

I have never been a good sleeper and since having Fibromyalgia it has become even harder to get good
quality rest. I found it difficult to get to sleep and would wake frequently in the night leaving me tired and
unrefreshed every morning. I tried lots of different things to help me sleep. These are the ones that
worked for me:

### Memory foam
Some of my sleep problems were exacerbated by being in pain and I discovered that the type of mattress I
slept on had a big impact on my pain levels. I simply could not get comfortable. The best mattress I have
found for reducing this discomfort is one with memory foam – either entirely foam or with a good sized
topper of memory foam.

### Blackout blinds
Being a light sleeper anything and everything wakes me up. If the room is light I struggle to go back to
sleep. Blackout blinds help in two ways – they stop the light from waking me in the first place and if I do
wake for some reason they make the room dark enough to signal my brain that it is not morning yet so I
can go back to sleep.

### Ear plugs
I don’t sleep deeply so noises often wake me – birds, traffic, my partner snoring – and ear plugs help to
stop these frequent distractions. I have tried several types but for me the most comfortable ones are either
the squidgy silicone ones or the wax ones that mould to your ear shape.

### White noise machines
Sometimes, even with the ear plugs in, certain noises (snoring!) are loud enough to keep me awake. On
those occasions I switch on my white noise machine to drown it out. My husband doesn’t like the white
noise so I also have sleep headphones which are basically a fabric headband with small flat speakers
inside that is comfortable to wear even lying on my side. I sometimes pull the headband down over my
eyes too to act as a sleep mask!

### Melatonin
As I struggle to fall asleep I now take melatonin at bedtime and within 15 minutes or so I can feel my
eyes getting heavy. My husband is amazed how quickly I fall asleep these days having experienced how
much I used to toss and turn and huff and puff about it before.

### Melissa dream supplement
I take Melissa Dream which helps me to stay asleep with less waking (although there is inevitably at least
one trip to the loo in the night!) and I feel like I sleep deeper when I use it. I also noticed I tend to have
less aches and pains in the morning – whether that is due to the tablet or just an affect of better sleep I am
not sure.

### Pillows
I have umpteen pillows in the bed with me - one between my knees, one under my legs, one that my arm
rests on – basically I use them to prop me up and get into a comfortable position. If I try and sleep with
just a pillow under my head I get very uncomfortable, sleep badly and wake up in lots of pain. I take up a
fair amount of room in the bed these days with all my pillows but my husband prefers me to be rested and
not tired grumpy so he puts up with it, thankfully!
