# How I overcame Fibromyalgia sleep problems

I have never been a good sleeper, and since having Fibromyalgia, it has become even harder to get good
quality rest. I found it difficult to get to sleep and would wake frequently in the night, leaving me tired
and unrefreshed every morning. I tried lots of different things to help me; these are the ones that worked
for me:

## Environment

### Memory foam

Some of my sleep problems were exacerbated by being in pain, and I discovered that the type of mattress I slept on had a big impact on my pain levels. I simply could not get comfortable. The best mattress I have found for reducing this discomfort is one with memory foam – either entirely foam or with a generous topper of memory foam.

### Blackout blinds/eye mask

Being a light sleeper, anything and everything wakes me up. If the room is light, I struggle to go back to sleep. Blackout blinds help in two ways – they stop the light from waking me in the first place, and if I do wake for some reason, they make the room dark enough to signal my brain that it is not morning yet, so I can go back to sleep.
I also tried wearing an eye mask, but I’m not totally happy with the feel of it on my face; it makes me a little claustrophobic. I do use it occasionally but only for short periods, such as when I wake up early on a bright morning and the light is creeping around the edges of the blackout blinds.

### Pillows

I have umpteen pillows in the bed with me - one between my knees, one under my legs, one that my arm rests on – basically I use them to prop me up and get into a comfortable position. If I try and sleep with just a pillow under my head, I get very uncomfortable, sleep badly, and wake up in lots of pain. I take up a fair amount of room in the bed these days with all my pillows, but my husband prefers me to be rested and not tired grumpy, so he puts up with it, thankfully!

## Drugs

### Melatonin

As I struggle to fall asleep, I now take melatonin at bedtime, and within 15 minutes or so, I can feel my eyes getting heavy. My husband is amazed at how quickly I fall asleep these days, having experienced how much I used to toss and turn before.

### Melissa dream supplement

I take Melissa Dream tablets which helps me to stay asleep (although there is inevitably at least one trip to the loo in the night!) and I feel like I sleep deeper when I use it. I also noticed I tend to have fewer aches and pains in the morning – whether that is due to the tablet or just an effect of better sleep I am not sure.

## Devices

### Earplugs

Noises often wake me – birds, traffic, my partner snoring – and ear plugs help to stop these frequent distractions. I have tried several types, but for me, the most comfortable ones are either the squidgy silicone ones or the wax ones that mould to your ear shape.

### White noise machines

Sometimes, even with the earplugs in, certain noises (snoring!) are loud enough to keep me awake. On those occasions, I switch on my white noise machine to drown it out. My husband doesn’t like the white noise, so I also have sleep headphones which are basically a fabric headband with small flat speakers inside that is comfortable to wear even lying on my side. If I pull it down over my eyes, it can double as a sleep mask too!
