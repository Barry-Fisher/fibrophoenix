# Ultrasound for Fibromyalgia pain relief

> If I had to choose only one thing to help me control my Fibromyalgia pain levels I would choose ultrasound.

I first discovered ultrasound, some years ago, when I went for sports therapy massage and the therapist
offered to ultrasound a particularly tight area for me. I had no idea before then that it could be used for
relieving painful muscles.

Shortly after, I had a bad problem with my shoulder and the therapist suggested
having daily ultrasound for a few days to get it under control. It worked. This was a revelation me.

Massage felt good at the time but rarely gave me any long term pain relief whereas ultrasound really did. I
tried this again a few times when I had other pain problems that were getting too much for me to manage
myself with my usual heat pads and pain killers and again it worked for me. In the end I decided it made
sense for me to learn how to use an ultrasound machine and look to see if I could buy one for myself.
That way I had 24hr access to pain relief.

Nowadays, I don’t use my machine daily, as a general rule; my pain levels are pretty much under control
due to my ability to manage my condition. However, even with the best management plan I can achieve
there will always be times when I still end up in pain; that’s just the nature of living with Fibromyalgia.
Pain that appears in one area and then moves around (in the weird fashion common to Fibromyalgia) I
don’t usually bother to ultrasound but when the same area hurts for a more than a couple of days, I know
it is time to get the ultrasound out and be ‘zapped’ to knock it on the head before it becomes a persistent
problem. I find every morning and every evening for two or three days usually sorts me out.

It cost me just under £400 to buy the machine at the time, plus I need to buy the ultrasound gel every now
and then but it has saved me a lot of pain and money in the long run. The cost of ultrasound machines has
come down considerably since then as I discovered when I bought my parents one for my dad’s back pain
last year. Their machine is also a lot more compact and portable than mine too so I may well at some
point in the future sell mine on and invest in a smaller model.

**It is definitely my favourite pain relief purchase to date.**
