# 7 things I avoid when sitting to reduce Fibromyalgia pain

Most people know that activity can trigger problems for people with Fibromyalgia. I have discovered,
though, that sitting down can equally be problematic. The type of seat, the way it is aligned with whatever
I am watching or whoever I am talking to, and also how long I sit for all affect my pain levels.

### What I avoid:

1. Hard materials
2. Bucket seats
3. Shallow seats
4. Lipped or ridged base or backs
5. Narrow armrests
6. Twisting/looking sideways
7. Uneven ground

### What I look for:

1. Reclining
2. Padded
3. Headrest
4. Low
5. Deep seat
6. Armrests
7. Angled straight on
8. Level seat/floor

### Types of seat

* My favourite seat is a reclining sofa with a cushion behind my back (and even better, a heat pad!). My
head is supported, and my legs are elevated. In this position, I can comfortably sit for several hours.
* Other sofas can be fairly good – padded seats are always better than non-padded seats. Lack of
headrests, however, such as on trendy low backed sofas, are not at all good for me if I am required to sit
for long periods.
* If the sofa doesn’t recline, then lower is better – this goes for all chairs. It gives me the option to
stretch my legs out or bend my knees in, altering position which helps prevent muscle stiffness.
* Bucket seats are terrible – they offer only one, very poor way of sitting, and I can’t tolerate these for
very long at all.
* Shallow seats that you have to sit far back on, such as church pews, are also bad for the same reason; I
can’t shift position much.
* Anything with a lip or edge that puts pressure on the back of my legs or my back is to be avoided.
That pressure can very quickly trigger a pain response.
* Armrests can be good. They allow the weight to be taken from the shoulders. Sometimes armrests can
be quite narrow, though, and the sides of the chair can press against my legs and hips. Again, this leading
to the pressure pain response.

### Alignment of chair

* If the chair is pointed directly at the person or thing I am focussed on, I will be comfortable for a lot
longer. Any sideways twisting puts more stress on one side of my muscles, and that imbalance can
quickly elicit a pain response. This is even the case if just my head is turned sideways for any length of
time. My close friends know that I will not turn to look at them much if they are sitting beside me.
* Another alignment problem is the height of the chair – for instance, I went to a planetarium where the
chair was tilted backwards. I thought this would be enough not to strain my neck, but the tilt was not sufficient
and I had to angle my head back to look at the presentation, and lo and behold, my muscles
started to hurt fairly quickly. The same is true for the height of computer monitor; it needs to be at eye
line to prevent neck ache for me.
* How level the floor is that the chair sits on is a big one for me. Park benches on uneven ground are
dodgy territory for me. My hips are at an uneven height, so there is an imbalance in the muscles resulting
in – you guessed it – pain.

### How long I sit

* As I mentioned above, I can sit for quite a while in a recliner sofa, but even in this, my most
comfortable sitting position, I have to be careful not to over-do it. Too many hours sitting can lead to
stiffness and back pain for me. Sitting at a computer desk is worse, so as you can see I couldn’t do an 8
hour/day desk job. Thankfully, my work is more versatile (by design) so I can move as needed to stay as
comfortable as possible.
* Other chairs vary greatly as to how long I can sit in them. Most chairs, I can tolerate for short periods,
but the more problematic features they have, as discussed above, the sooner the pain kicks in.
As you can see, seats for me are a mine-field. It’s no wonder my Fibro friends and I joke about being like
the Princess and the Pea!
