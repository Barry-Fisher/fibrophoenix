# Accepting Fibromyalgia

It took me a long time to accept that I had Fibromyalgia.

I knew, of course, logically, that I had it but
emotionally, I felt that if I if I accepted I had limitations, I was giving in and giving up. I couldn’t have
been more wrong.

I remember, in the early days, getting so angry about my new limitations that I was determined to ‘push
through’ and thought that if I only tried hard enough I could overcome it and still do the things I used to
do. I tried to walk to a friend’s house who was an hour’s walk away. Not only did I not make it but I
landed myself in a lot of pain and I had to call my friend and explain what I had done and ask her to come
and rescue me from the side of the road. That little rebellion cost me a few days in bed.

I also tried to exercise the way I used to do. I would swim 50 lengths of my pool. Strangely enough, I felt
okay while I was in the pool but the crash would come afterwards and again I landed in bed for days. I
would wait until I had recovered and repeat the whole stupid process again.
Over and over again, I made myself worse; I ensured that I had more pain and fatigue and ultimately I
was in more physical and emotional distress.

The irony is that, back then, when I hadn’t accepted my condition, I wasn’t looking after myself, pacing
and managing my condition as I was in denial that I had to; once I accepted it and started researching
what it meant to live with Fibromyalgia, I began to learn ways to look after myself that meant I had less
pain and more energy and suddenly, I was able to do more of the things I used to be able to.

I am now very aware, at all times, of my condition. I am constantly making adjustments to allow for my
needs and making decisions based on my limitations. This may sound restrictive but I have gone from not
being able to walk up a flight of stairs (at my worst point) to now being able to run up stairs (only one
flight though, I’m not superwoman!).

I live a very full life - I’m also two years through a three year
college course, I am writing a series of novels, I am back teaching dancing in the evenings and I can
comfortably walk for about 45mins as long as it’s fairly flat and I’m not going too fast. (I still don’t swim,
though, as it aggravates a shoulder injury I have.)

Most people who meet me have no idea that I have
Fibromyalgia, unless I tell them.

All of this – ALL of it – has come from accepting my condition. Rather
than trying to fight it, I now work with it instead.
